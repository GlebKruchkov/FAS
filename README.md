## The full name of the application is "Films and serials".

My app is aimed at helping people choose movies or serials for the evening. So, when launching the application, you must register or log in to your account(at the same time, data about registered users is stored in the Firebase database, which is linked to my application)
After registration, you can choose what to watch: a movie or a TV series. And the desired genre of the movie/series. Next, you select a movie/TV series from the list of suggested ones. Each of them can be added to favorites or watch a trailer.
Favorites data is also stored in Firebase (each unique user has their own set of favorite movies and TV shows). You can also log in to your profile and see which movies and TV shows have been added to favorites.
